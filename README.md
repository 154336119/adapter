# Limit
* Currently, don't do getItemView().setTag() ,because ItemView tag has be set to retain Helper object .

# Dependencies
* Glide-3.7.0.jar == for load url image , of course you can replace it with other image load library .

#Thanks
* Inspired by JoanZapata's base-adapter-helper (https://github.com/JoanZapata/base-adapter-helper) .
* Thanks JoaZapata(https://github.com/JoanZapata) for his greate job .
